## What is Clearly?

Clearly uses an intelligent Q&A wizard to guide both technical and non-technical team members through the specification process, generating actionable outputs that work seamlessly with modern development workflows.

## Latest Features

We're still in beta with a small group of early users, and the feedback has been invaluable in shaping these features.

### Contextual Tips

Not everyone speaks the same technical language. Now when Clearly asks a question, you'll see helpful tips explaining what we're asking and why it matters. Each sample answer includes detailed explanations, pros and cons, so you can make informed decisions—no matter your technical background.

### Real-time Collaboration
