## Software Development Process

From prototype to production in the age of AI-assisted coding

## What is the Software Development Process?

The software development process is a structured approach to building software that transforms initial ideas into production-ready applications. In the age of AI-assisted coding, while prototypes can be created rapidly, the journey from prototype to production still requires careful planning, documentation, and systematic execution.

Modern development processes balance the speed of AI-powered tools with the rigor needed for reliable, maintainable, and secure software systems.

## Key Stages of Development

## Why a Structured Process Still Matters

## Getting Started with Structured Development

Clearly helps you follow a structured development process by guiding you through requirements gathering, documentation creation, and project planning. Start with a BRD to define business needs, create a PRD to specify product features, and follow proven development practices.
