## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Transforming business needs into detailed product specifications

## What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a detailed specification that translates business requirements into concrete product features and functionality. It serves as the bridge between business objectives and technical implementation, providing development teams with clear direction on what to build and how it should work.

Unlike a BRD which focuses on the **why**, a PRD focuses on the **what** and **how**, detailing every feature, interaction, and technical requirement needed to bring the product to life.

## BRD vs PRD: Understanding the Difference

### BRD

Focuses on the "why"

- Business objectives
- Stakeholder needs
- High-level requirements
- Success metrics

### PRD

Focuses on the "what" and "how"

- Detailed feature specs
- User interactions
- Technical requirements
- Implementation details
