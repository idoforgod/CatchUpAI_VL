## About Clearly

We're on a mission to make professional requirements documentation accessible to everyone, bridging the gap between ideas and implementation.

## Our Mission

In the age of AI-assisted development, the gap between idea and implementation is closing rapidly. However, clear requirements remain the foundation of successful projects. Clearly empowers teams to articulate their vision with professional BRDs and PRDs, ensuring AI tools and human developers alike understand exactly what needs to be built.

## Our Values

## Why We Built Clearly

As developers, we've experienced the pain of unclear requirements countless times. Projects stall, features get built wrong, and teams waste time on rework - all because requirements weren't clearly documented from the start.

With the rise of AI coding assistants, this problem became even more critical. AI tools can build software incredibly fast, but they need clear instructions. "Garbage in, garbage out" has never been more true.

We realized that the bottleneck wasn't coding anymore - it was requirements. Many teams skip formal BRDs and PRDs because they seem too time-consuming or complicated. But without them, even the best AI tools will build the wrong thing.

That's why we built Clearly: to make creating professional requirements documents as easy as having a conversation. Now anyone can articulate their vision clearly, ensuring successful projects whether they're built by humans, AI, or both.
