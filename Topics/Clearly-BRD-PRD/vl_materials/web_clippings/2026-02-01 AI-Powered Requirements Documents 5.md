## Business Requirements Document (BRD)

The foundation for successful software projects

## What is a BRD?

A Business Requirements Document (BRD) is a formal document that clearly defines what a software project must accomplish from a business perspective. It serves as the bridge between business needs and technical implementation, ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding of the project's goals and requirements.

Unlike technical specifications, a BRD focuses on the **what** and **why**, leaving the *how* to subsequent technical planning and design phases.

## Key Components of a BRD
